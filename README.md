# Maryland Car Crashes Analysis (Sept â€“ Dec 2021)

## Project Overview
This project was conducted as part of the **Intro to Data Science (601)** course. The objective was to perform an in-depth analysis of car crash data from Maryland, focusing on identifying patterns related to car make, model, and year. The goal was to provide insights that could help manufacturers improve product quality and safety.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Analysis**: Detailed exploration and cleaning of vehicle datasets, focusing on variables such as car make, model, and year.
- **Fatal Crash Identification**: Analyzed patterns and identified specific car models involved in fatal crashes.
- **Actionable Insights**: Generated recommendations for car manufacturers on how to improve product quality based on the analysis results.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and insights generation.

## Key Analysis Highlights:
1. **Car Models and Fatal Crashes**: The analysis revealed significant patterns involving specific car models and their involvement in fatal crashes.
2. **Model Year Analysis**: Trends were observed regarding the correlation between vehicle model year and the likelihood of fatal accidents.
3. **Manufacturer Insights**: Recommendations were provided for manufacturers to enhance product quality based on the identified patterns.

## How to Run the Project:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maryland-car-crashes-analysis.git
